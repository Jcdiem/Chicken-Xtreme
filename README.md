# Chicken XTREME

## Another one?
Okay, just hear me out: Chicken is my go to name for any project I don't intend to 100% finish to perfection. It helps me to view my projects from an objective view and just learn what I want to.

This rendetion of Chicken will be completed to the point of Chicken 2, about. My goal with this project is to be able to use it as my WCTC Intro to Javascript course final project. I'm starting work early because I'm bored and really should have just tested out, but at this point may as well as learn some tidbits from the intro class and have some fun.

## Using and Timeline
### How to use
General: Visit <a href="https://jcdiem.github.io/Chicken-Xtreme/">The GitHub Pages</a> <br>
I usually don't push to the GitHub unless it's somewhat working, so this should be relatively stable.

Unstable: Vist <a href="https://fac.diemconsulting.net/xchicken/index.html">my dev site</a> to see if I've changed anything since my last commit

Self-Host: Host a web server and throw these files somewhere in it ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Timeline
Class ends December, so guess that's my limit. I'm not going to spend the time making a Trello-like board for this, so just follow the commits for what's going on. I'm usually pretty good about describing comments. I'll also leave a changelog to follow previous progress for 'full' changes.

### Changelog
#### V 0.0.3 - Battle Framework
Added framework for a battling system. The BattleManager class can currently create enemies and give them stats, a name, and a random intent.
I hope to work on adding a specialised style based upon good stats, I.E. a health heavy enemy will play tank when with a partner, but right now all intents are random.

#### V 0.0.2 - Term Framework
Added the framework for the terminal. Basic commands 'help', 'cd', and 'clear' have been added.

#### V 0.0.1 - Design Framework
Got the framework for the design down. I have it formatted out how I want it to look, along with fonts and color schemes. Just have to start adding actual content now.
